# ðŸ“Š Insurance Data Analysis and Dashboard (Power BI)

[cite_start]This project presents a comprehensive analysis of insurance data, visualized through an interactive dashboard built using **Microsoft Power BI**[cite: 379]. [cite_start]The main goal is to identify key patterns, evaluate policy performance, and provide actionable insights for data-driven decisions in risk management and revenue optimization[cite: 379, 377].
The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to explore various facets of the insurance portfolio, focusing on the following areas:

* [cite_start]**Customer Distribution:** Analyzing the geographic distribution of policyholders (e.g., regions with the highest number of policies or claims)[cite: 379].
* [cite_start]**Cost Drivers:** Investigating the correlation between customer characteristics (e.g., age, gender, smoking status) and insurance charges/premiums[cite: 379].
* [cite_start]**Claims Performance:** Identifying the main factors influencing high or low claim amounts and comparing them across different demographics (smokers vs. non-smokers, etc.)[cite: 379].
* [cite_start]**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The dashboard includes critical metrics calculated using DAX, such as **Average Charges** and **Total Policyholders**[cite: 379].
* * [cite_start]**Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI (used to design the interactive dashboard)[cite: 379].
* [cite_start]**Data Modeling & Measures:** Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI for complex calculations and custom KPIs[cite: 379].
* [cite_start]**Data Source:** A dataset containing key attributes like Age, Gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), Number of Children, Smoking Status, and Charges[cite: 379].

**Note:** The original Power BI file (`insurance.pbix`) is available in this repository. To interact with the dashboard, you need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your system.
